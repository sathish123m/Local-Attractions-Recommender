# Objective:
To provide a tailor made plan consisting of possible places to stay, attractions to visit and restaurants to eat at for the entire duration of travel. We recommend restaurants separately for each meal of the day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and provide two recommendations per meal per day. We also recommend five possible stay options (hotels) for your travel alongside possible attractions to view. Attractions are recommended based on timing, (i.e) which ones to view during the day and which ones are better off at night. Again we provide two attraction recommendations per timing per day for the entire duration of travel.

# Project Overview:
We have used three different recommender systems (one each for attractions, hotels and restaurants).
1. RBM, a Deep learning technique for Attractions.
2. Matrix Factorization with ALS, a highly scalable and distributed Collaborative Filtering technique for hotels.
3. Hybrid- A combination of K-Means algorithm for Content Based Filtering and K-Nearest Neighbors for Memory based Collaborative Filtering for restaurants.

Few visualizations for the project were done using python libraries and others have been done using Tableau software. They can be accessed from [EDA](/EDA) folder.
